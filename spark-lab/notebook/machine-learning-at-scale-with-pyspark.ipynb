    "PySpark is a Python API for Spark released by the Apache Spark community to support Python with Spark. Using PySpark, one can easily integrate and work with RDDs in Python programming language too. There are numerous features that make PySpark such an amazing framework when it comes to working with huge datasets. Whether it is to perform computations on large datasets or to just analyze them, Data Engineers are switching to this tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of PySpark\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Real-time computations: Because of the in-memory processing in the PySpark framework, it shows low latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Polyglot: The PySpark framework is compatible with various languages such as Scala, Java, Python, and R, which makes it one of the most preferable frameworks for processing huge datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Caching and disk persistence: This framework provides powerful caching and great disk persistence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Fast processing: The PySpark framework is way faster than other traditional frameworks for Big Data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Works well with RDDs: Python programming language is dynamically typed, which helps when working with RDDs.\n"

    "Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances. "

It is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. k-means clustering minimizes within-cluster variances (squared Euclidean distances), but not regular Euclidean distances, which would be the more difficult Weber problem: the mean optimizes squared errors, whereas only the geometric median minimizes Euclidean distances. For instance, better Euclidean solutions can be found using k-medians and k-medoids."
